This is a compilation of community experiences and tests from members of [theta360.guide](http://theta360.guide), an
independent developer community for RICOH THETA cameras.  The *community-created* document you are reading may contain factual errors. Please help the community to 
update this document using pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/theta360developers/plugin-guide).

## THETA V Plugin Application Development Overview

The THETA V uses Android as the operating system. Because of this, the THETA V application development process is the same as the development process for an Android phone. Connect the THETA V to a development workstation, either Mac, Windows, or Linux with a micro USB cable and connect to the camera with adb. You will need a THETA V 
that is in developer mode. To put your THETA V into developer mode during the closed-beta period, 
please contact jcasman@oppkey.com. He will need
to get physical access to your camera. More
information on a process to put the THETA V into developer mode remotely should be available when the 
THETA V partner program is launched in 2018 (specific date of launch has not been announced).
